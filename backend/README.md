# Backend API Documentation

This directory contains the backend codebase for the application, built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

---

# Folder Structure

The backend follows a standard **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architecture.

```

├── config/           # Configuration files (e.g., database connection)
│   └── db.js         # MongoDB connection setup
├── controllers/      # Route handlers implementing the core logic
│   ├── authController.js # Handles registration and login logic
│   └── userController.js # Handles user-related operations
├── middlewares/      # Custom Express middlewares
├── models/           # Mongoose schemas representing database collections
│   └── userModel.js  # User schema definition
├── routes/           # API route definitions mapping URLs to controllers
│   ├── auth.js       # Authentication routes (/api/auth)

```

---

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed:

* Node.js
* MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)

---

## Installation

Navigate to the backend directory:

```
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory.

Example:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/uni_find
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

| Variable    | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| PORT        | Port where the backend server runs         |
| MONGO_URI   | MongoDB database connection string         |
| CORS_ORIGIN | Allowed frontend origins for CORS requests |

Multiple origins can be specified using commas:

```
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

---

# Running the Server

Start the server in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

Or run normally:

```
npm start
```

The backend will start at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

# API Routes

## 1. Authentication Routes

Base URL:

```
/api/auth
```

### Register User

**Endpoint**

```
POST /api/auth/register
```

**Description**

Registers a new user in the system.

**Request Body**

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

**Response**

```
201 Created
```

Returns the newly created user and a success message.

---

### Login User

**Endpoint**

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

**Description**

Authenticates a user using email and password.

**Request Body**

```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

**Response**

```
200 OK
```

Returns user information and login confirmation.

---

## 2. User Routes

Base URL:

```
/api/users
```

### Get Current User Profile

**Endpoint**

```
GET /api/users/me
```

**Description**

Placeholder endpoint for retrieving the authenticated user's profile.

**Response**

```json
{
  "message": "User profile endpoint - To be implemented with JWT"
}
```

---

# Security Middleware

The backend includes several security-related middleware to protect the application from common web vulnerabilities.

---

## Helmet

Helmet is used to secure HTTP response headers.

Helmet helps protect the application from attacks such as:

* Clickjacking
* MIME-type sniffing
* Some Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks

Helmet is applied globally in `server.js`.

Example:

```
app.use(helmet());
```

This ensures every response from the server includes secure HTTP headers.

---

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

CORS controls which external domains can access the API.

Instead of allowing all origins, the backend allows only specific origins defined in the environment configuration.

Example configuration in `server.js`:

```
const allowedOrigins = process.env.CORS_ORIGIN
  ? process.env.CORS_ORIGIN.split(",")
  : ["http://localhost:3000"];

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: allowedOrigins,
    credentials: true
  })
);
```

This prevents unauthorized domains from accessing the API.

---

## Rate Limiting

The login endpoint is protected using rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

Rate limiting restricts how many requests a user can send within a certain time period.

Applied to:

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

Example configuration:

```
const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 5,
  message: {
    error: "Too many login attempts. Please try again later."
  }
});
```

This configuration allows:

* Maximum **5 login attempts**
* Within **15 minutes**
* Per **IP address**

If the limit is exceeded, the API returns:

```json
{
  "error": "Too many login attempts. Please try again later."
}
```

with status code:

```
429 Too Many Requests
```

---

# Summary

The backend now includes the following security improvements:

* Secure HTTP headers using Helmet
* Controlled cross-origin access using CORS
* Protection against brute-force login attempts using rate limiting

These security measures help make the backend safer for real-world use and provide a reusable pattern for securing future API endpoints.
